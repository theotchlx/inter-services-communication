# inter-services-communication

A Proof of Concept, in Rust, to compare communication frameworks for inter-services communication inside a microservices architecture.

## Demonstration

To run the server, run `cargo run --bin server`. To run the client, run `cargo run --bin client` in another terminal window.

You should see the request logged out by the server in its terminal window, as well as the response logged out by the client in its window.
